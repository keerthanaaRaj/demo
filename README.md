Keerthanaa,

I am very glad to know about you. It is perfectly okay that you come from a biology background and do not have knowledge in coding yet — every coder starts from zero. What matters most is your interest to learn, and you already have that spark. With patience and consistent effort, I am sure you will pick it up step by step.

Thank you for trusting me with your learning. I will guide you in coding step by step, starting from the basics, so that you never feel lost. Don’t worry about making mistakes — every mistake is part of learning. If you follow consistently, I am confident you will not only understand coding but also excel in it.

Stay positive, be patient with yourself, and believe that you can achieve great things. One day, I am sure you will make both your parents proud by entering a good company and becoming successful in life.

All the very best, Keerthanaa — your journey has just begun, and I will be here to guide you through it.
